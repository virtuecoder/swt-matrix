2012 Q4

Maintenance:
- Seperate build for retail and free version.
- Update the web site.
- Update tutorial/manual
- Improve unit test coverage, especially grouping and tree

New features:
- Before/after callbacks for commands with possibility to cancel the command. (Cycle detection)
- Possibility to stop long running command.
- Allow bind/unbind for drag and drop gestures
- Move tree API from Section to a seperate class, similar approach as Grouping.
- Drag and drop into a tree item besides existing before/after
- Style.textMarginLeft and Style.textMarginRight. Refactor Style.textMargin into a setter. The same for image margin.
- Painter cache for shortenned text
- Text shortening by dots at the end 
- Introduce events: LAYOUT_CHANGE, ITEM_COUNT_CHANGE.
- Axis.setFrozenHead(Section) freezes at the end of given section and changes when item count of the proceeding section is altered. The same for setFrozenTail(Section)
- Axis.setFrozenHead(Axis.getHeader()) is done by default.
- Add Zone.removeListener(listener)

Bug fixes:
- Drag and drop of a group of items just before or after one of the selected does not work.
- Section.setSelected should highlight the cells in matrix.


Commands: undo, record, replay
Grouping: collapse to end
Grouping: summary column
Grouping: moving items


Multithreaded compute of x and y axis
Binary search in sequence.seek
Zone.addControlListener to get notification when an item is resized or moved.
Fix matrix not visible on other layouts then FillLayout.
Does not refresh on shell.open without shell.setBounds.
Axis.setSelected(from position, to position) ?

From nebula forum
- different colors for the fore- and background of cells. If i select one colored cell, the selection "overwrites" the color setting, so that every selected cell looks the same. Is there a way to change the color of selected cells, so that i can still see the differences?
- Nebula CompositeTable, flexible row layout

To do:
- multi column sorting
- draw button cell selected as pushed
- freeze line painters are by default
- partial redraw/paint cell, zone, row column
- painter top, bottom, left, right margins for text and image instead of x, y margins
- add to Zone and Section @see #getListeners(int)   * @see #removeListener(int, Listener)   * @see #notifyListeners
- scroll to focus on resizing
- Replace refresh() with layout() and redraw()
- various matrix layouts?
- emulate combo
- snippet hide control instead of dispose
- sample on different editor in for edit then display
- asynchronous mode in GestureBinding for command processing, cancel.
- compile snippets to demo
- make the matrix composable in the WindowBuilder
- avoid flickering when rezizing with embedded controls

- MatrixView to support ContentProvider, LabelProvider, Column, etc

- snippet to swap axises
- width of line at the edge of sections schould be maximum of the width from both sections

? constructor style options SWT.CHECK, SWT.LEFT_TO_RIGHT | SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT


- thread safety
- immutable indexes

- cell editors
- multicell edit

- Typed events, ensure event properties compatibility with SWT Table
- tooltips
- styles
- column chooser
- CTRL+SHIFT for selection
- traverse out of the matrix on tab
- trigger selection event on selection
- trigger move/resize event on move/resize
- default cut/copy/paste works against excel
- sorting indicator
- quick search

- eliminate scroll bar shaking
- pixel scrolling
- catch exceptions in auto scroll thread
- remove autoscroll thread when finished
- scrolling animation
- moving animation
- move not continuous selection of items
- auto filters example

Model
- list of POJO
- glazed list integration
- filtering 
- sorting
- validation

Less priority
- Text shortening by dots at the end 
- Nebula Grid API proxy
- Performance: All painters use global method to set foreground/background which is only run if the latest color is defferent then the current one.
? Fast cursor paint on matrix.redraw(x,y,w,h,
? Sequence, IntSequence(from, to), collection sequence, descending, remove, insert before, insert after.

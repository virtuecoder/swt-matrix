- different colors for the fore- and background of cells. If i select one colored cell, the selection "overwrites" the color setting, so that every selected cell looks the same. Is there a way to change the color of selected cells, so that i can still see the differences?
- I wanted to support the MS Excel features in my RCP app. Features like 'Auto Filter'.
- Nebula CompositeTable, flexible row layout

To do:
- single focus cell should not be considered selected (like in spreadsheets)
- snippet with selection background and custom foreground
- scroll to focus on resizing
- Replace refresh() with layout() and redraw()
- various matrix layouts?
- emulate combo
- snippet hide control instead of dispose
- sample on different editor in for edit then display
- asynchronous mode in GestureBinding for command processing, cancel.
- readme.txt for snippets and individual snippet files comment about images
- compile snippets to demo
- make the matrix composable in the WindowBuilder
- avoid flickering when rezizing with embedded controls
- multiline text, text wraping
- MatrixView to support ContentProvider, LabelProvider, Column, etc

- snippet to swap axises
- width of line at the edge of sections schould be maximum of the width from both sections

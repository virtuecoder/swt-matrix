Zone.addControlListener to get notification when an item is resized or moved.
Move selection logic from listener to section. Section.setSelected should highlight the cells in matrix.
Fix drag and drop of a group of items just before or after one of the selected one.
Fix matrix not visible on other layouts then FillLayout.
Does not refresh on shell.open without shell.setBounds.

Axis.setSelected(from position, to position) ?


Samples:
summary
reorder
hide item
custom background
push button headers
alter selection
variable row height
variable line width
freezing
line color
text color
cell background
text, image aligning 
text, image margin
embedded progress bar, checkbox
combo editor
zone listener

copy paste
autoscroll 
drag indicator
column width compress

From nebula forum
- different colors for the fore- and background of cells. If i select one colored cell, the selection "overwrites" the color setting, so that every selected cell looks the same. Is there a way to change the color of selected cells, so that i can still see the differences?
- I wanted to support the MS Excel features in my RCP app. Features like 'Auto Filter'.
- Nebula CompositeTable, flexible row layout

To do:
- multi column sorting
- draw button cell selected as pushed
- freeze line painters are by default
- partial redraw/paint cell, zone, row column
- painter top, bottom, left, right margins for text and image instead of x, y margins
- add to Zone and Section @see #getListeners(int)   * @see #removeListener(int, Listener)   * @see #notifyListeners
- scroll to focus on resizing
- Replace refresh() with layout() and redraw()
- various matrix layouts?
- emulate combo
- snippet hide control instead of dispose
- sample on different editor in for edit then display
- asynchronous mode in GestureBinding for command processing, cancel.
- compile snippets to demo
- make the matrix composable in the WindowBuilder
- avoid flickering when rezizing with embedded controls

- MatrixView to support ContentProvider, LabelProvider, Column, etc

- snippet to swap axises
- width of line at the edge of sections schould be maximum of the width from both sections

Less priority
- Text shortening by dots at the end 
- Nebula Grid API proxy
- Performance: All painters use global method to set foreground/background which is only run if the latest color is defferent then the current one.

Freeze - head and tail freezing split the matrix client area into 


Painting
Anything that apears on the matrix canvas is drawn by the paint method of the Painter class.

A painter can be identified by a name and is characterized by its scope. Matrix painters disregard the scope and are alwyas called once with the full matrix boundaries. A zone painter can be called many times with various boundaries depending on its scope. Scopes are expressed by the constants defined in Painter class and prefixed with SCOPE_.

Both Matrix and Zones have lists of painters which define the drawing order of the content elements such as background, images, text, lines. The number and order of painters is fully configarable. Matrix comes with the following painters in the following order by default:
dock main main
dock tail head
dock head tail
dock main tail
dock tail main
dock tail tail
dock main head
dock head main
dock head head
focus cell

A dock painter paints all the zones that it contains. The zone painting order can be set by {@link Matrix#setZonePaintOrder(int[])} and it is used by all dock painters. The default zone painting order is a cartesian product of default section painting orders of row axis and column axis, where body is the first, then the sections following body in ascending order and then the sections proceeding body in descending order. 






Current Item (revize it)
Current item is in another words a focus cell or a cursor, but those terms have already a different meaning in the context of SWT. Current item can be enabled for each axis individually or both at once by <code>Matrix.setCurrentCellEnabled()</code> Row axis has the current item enabled by default, column axis does not. Current item can be set individually for each axis by 
The current cell is painted by <code>Matrix.currentCellPainters</code> if both of the axis have the current item enabled. The default painter draws a black two point rectangular around the current cell. 
Current cell is also a selected cell. If only one axis has the current item enabled then the whole item (row or column) is selected by the cursor movement.



Selection
Subject to selection can be cells and axis items (rows and columns).
Matrix <code>select</code> and <code>deselect</code> methods are used for cell selection.
MatrixAxis <code>select</code> and <code>deselect</code> methods are used for axis item selection.

The special cases of selection behavior:
- (Not implemented yet). Selecting all the body zone cells in a row or column causes this row or column to be selected on the axis.
- Selecting an axis item causes selection of all the cells at crossing of this items and all the items from all sections of the perpendicular axis. For example all row cells: <code>| row header cell | filter cell | body cells | footer cell |</code>.
- When any cell in the row becomes selected then the cell of the row header zone becomes selected as well. The same applies to columns. That is usefull for highlighting header cells of the selected body cells, line in spreadshits. The highlighting of header cells can turned off by <code>headerZone.setSelectionEnabled(false)</code>.
- (Not implemented yet). Deselecting cells from the body zone makes the rows and columns to which they belong deselected as well.
- Deselecting an axis item causes deselection of all the cells at crossing of this items and all the items from all sections of the perpendicular axis. For example all row cells: <code>| row header cell | filter cell | body cells | footer cell |</code>.
- When all cells in the row become deselected then the cell of the row header zone becomes deselected as well. The same applies to columns. 


Selection mode can be altered by <code>setSelectionMode</code> method of MatrixAxis class.
- SWT.FULL_SELECTION option enforces whole row or column selection,
- SWT.SINGLE option enforces only single item selection.
By default both SWT.FULL_SELECTION and SWT.SINGLE options are off.
If SWT.FULL_SELECTION are passed in style argument to the Matrix constructor then they are applied to the row axis.

The selection is bound to the following gestures
- Click and drag on column header or row header selectes axis items
- Click or drag in other zones selects cells in the zone
- Navigation keys alternatively with Shift modifier select a rectangular set of cells

Main concepts
- Matrix, MatrixAxis
- Cell and line
- AxisLayout
- Index
- Section
- Zone
- Dock
- Painters


	 * Section does not have add/remove methods for items, since item does not have a notion of content.
	 * It is only a reference to the data element. Whenever the data model adds / remove elements then 
	 * the section should adjusts its item core.count to match the current size the data model.

Performance
- Loop inversion: loop painters -> loop cells -> paint
- Caching the layout computation results, paint does not recompute widths, distances, visible indexes
- Caching results of GC.stringExtent for single characters of each font used in TextPainter.

Indexes
model index - original index that numbers the items in the model
order index - position of the model index in the order sequence
visible index - position of the model index in the order seqence after hiding some items
The letter one matches with what the user sees on the screen.

Selection and reordering is limited to the scope a single section only.

Command

Item reordering

Indexes to selection are interim (position in order sequence ignoring hiding). 
This is to naturaly support a scenario of for example selecting extent 
from column 4 to column 6 including a hidden column 5 in between.
